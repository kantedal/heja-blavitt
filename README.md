Functional description:
My goal is to create a web app with a news flow with relevant news about the football club IFK GÃ¶teborg. In this news flow the user will be able to comment, vote 
sort and filter the news.

Technical description:
I will use Angular 2 to create the web app, the goal is to make the app usable on both desktop and mobile. I will use Ionic 2 mainly for UI components, but this will
also allow me to build the app for both Android and iOS. To gather the news I will use a NodeJS server which will fetch and filter a RSS flow and save relevant news
to a MongoDB database. To get news to the app I will probably set up an Express REST API on the NodeJS server. I will write all code in TypeScript, which compiles 
down to es5 javascript.
